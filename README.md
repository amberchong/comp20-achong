Lab #8
23 April 2019

1. The purpose of a Git repository is to store code at various points in its development through commits.

2. My favorite assignment is the first assignment where we created our own website because we had a lot of freedom in how we organzized and styled content.

3. I have learned a lot about how the internet works and what is necessary to get a website/server running rather than just being the user of what is provided. Knowing the basis allows me to experiment with web development on my own. I also have continued to work on Assignment 1 to create my own web portfolio which I intend to improve over the summer while accruing more css skills. The semester project has also shown me that I am able to start my own projects and pursue them, demonstrating that my own growth depends on my eagerness to learn and practice what I have learned independently. 

4. The most important thing I learned in this course was how to style and design a page. First, I learned CSS to accompany HTML through labs and assignments, then I learned how to apply bootstrap supplementally through the semester project. I find this important to me just because it is most applicable to my interests currently and since I worked on front-end for the most part for the project and poured many hours in learning how to use css for my own web page, what I have practiced the most is shown in my work. 
	

5. I'd like to learn how to further improve web design and interface, could be through animations and amplified design elements. Also makes me wonder how app design works.
